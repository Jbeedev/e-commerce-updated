                           most current version of the User Terms at any time by visiting this page, and by visiting the

                           competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be modified by the court and
                           interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest
                           extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the User Terms will remain in

                           any pages referenced in these User Terms, the terms of these User Terms will first prevail;
                           provided, however, that if there is a conflict or inconsistency between the Contract and the
                           User Terms, the terms of the Contract will first prevail, followed by the provisions in these
                           User Terms, and then followed by the pages referenced in these User Terms (e.g., the Privacy
                           Policy). Customer will be responsible for notifying Authorized Users of those conflicts or
                           inconsistencies and until such time the terms set forth herein will be binding.</p>
